## Contributing

If you want to build the project or run the test, please replace `npm-shrinkwrap.json` by `npm-shrinkwrap.dev.json`. Then run `npm i` again.
It is a work around for the multiple problems npm currently has with its npm-shrinkwrap.json files and dev dependencies (https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/6298).

Build command: `npm run rebuild`

Test command: `npm run test`

Coverage command: `npm run coverage`
